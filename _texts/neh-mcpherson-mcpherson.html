WRITTEN BY HIMSELF. </h1> SECOND EDITION, WITH THE ORIGINAL DEDICATION AND PREFACE. LYNCHBURG, VA: PUBLISHED BY CHRISTOPHER McPHERSON SMITH. PRINTED AT THE VIRGINIAN JOB OFFICE, 1855. TO ALL THE INHABITERS OF THE EARTH, AND MORE ESPECIALLY TO THE CITIZENS OF THESE UNITED STATES, THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED BY THEIR FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT, CHRISTOPHER McPHERSON. <p> Given under my hand, and the seals of my appointment, in the the city of Richmond, and State of Virginia, on Tuesday, the 4th day of June, 1811, the 35th year of Columbian Independence, and the 13th year after planting in Columbia the seed of the Millennium of Christ Jesus our Lord. </p> CHRIST. McPHERSON, ( Seal. ) ALIAS PHERSON, SON OF CHRIST, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, ( Seal. ) PREFACE. <p> I am well aware that, in a country where “the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments,” and also in an age of reason and light that mankind would readily detect and expose any attempt towards imposition. I, therefore, in the conscious rectitude of my heart, the more readily mean to declare to the world, in an open and candid manner, all that is proper and necessary of what Omnipotence has given me in charge to disclose; and any man like Jonah, who shrinks from the mandates of his God, deserves countenance from no quarter whatever. </p> <p> Can there exist a doubt in a thinking mind that the Great Almighty Creator, who saw from the beginning, throughout to the end, will not bring about His all-wise decrees in the very express manner and form he thinks proper? All nature is spread before us. The Grand Word of God, the Bible, contains minute descriptions of miracles upon miracles, as well as of those which are still to come. It, therefore, appears plain to me that the only enquiry now is, whether my words deserve credit or not. Let the folllowing pages determine that question. </p> CHRIST. McPHERSON, ALIAS PHERSON, SON OF CHRIST, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, A Short History of the Author's Life. <p> The endeavor to keep up a connected train of circumstances, must apologize for repetitions in this compilation, as the documents will follow in rotation to support that train. </p> <p> I was brought up and emancipated by David Ross, esq. In time of the Revolutionary war, I was clerk to the Commercial Agent for the State of Virginia, and clerk for one of the Commissary Generals at the seige of Yorktown, in Virginia. I afterwards remained store-keeper and clerk for David Ross, esq., now living, until the 15th day of February, 1799; when in his office, at Columbia Virginia, I was converted to the true Faith of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I was shewn by the Holy Spirit in many visions, that these United States were the new Zion, the new Jerusalem of the Lord God, and he held them as the apple of his eye; and a new name was given me, and I was appointed a messenger to the world, and the word was to be given me from time to time. Soon after this, in the same year, the differences that subsisted between Mr. Ross' family and myself had grown to such a pitch, that I was obliged to leave his employ. I commenced suit against a son of his, which made it necessary for me to get certificates of my character, to be found herein, dated in 1799. On my leaving Mr. Ross, the Holy Spirit commanded me, and I cried aloud through the streets of Richmond, Williamsburg, Norfolk and Portsmouth, of the approach of Christ's Millennium, his reign in this world of 1,000 years. Whilst in Norfolk I wrote to several leading characters in the Union, advising of this event. (Copies of which letters are under cover of my letter of seven seals.) I was then commanded to go to Philadelphia and deliver a message from Omnipotence to President Adams and the Senate of the United States, which is of the utmost importance to the world, and particularly so to these United States, as well as to myself; they, however, did not act upon it. I remained in Philadelphia that winter, and wrote for the penitentiary there, and also enrolled for Congress; whilst there I was offered $1,000 per annum, board, &amp;c., to school people of color, but I was commanded of the Holy Spirit, and in the spring of 1800 I returned to Virginia, and married a lady of my own color, named Polly Burgess, and sat in and worked with uncommon ardor, night and day, both for in and worked with uncommon ardor, night and day, both for public and private offices, &amp;c., to be proved by the following list. In this way, ten years had nearly elapsed, when in the summer of 1810 the Holy Spirit commanded, and I sent into the common hall for the city of Richmond, a petition of the people of color, praying for a new burying ground, as the old one, in every respect, was perfectly unfit for the purpose, and to this day I have heard of no appropriation to this effect. The same day this petition was presented, the hall passed an ordinance, restricting free people of color from using hired carriages. I remonstrated by letter to four members of the hall; but getting no redress, I published in the Gazettes that I intended to petition the next general assembly for relief, and of course prepared certificates of my character, to be found under date of 1810, as well as the petition itself. The committee reported it reasonable, but it was lost in the assembly by a majority of three. I immediately bought me a hack and a pair of horses, and carried my invalid family to meeting to serve the Lord. Whilst before the committee of the general assembly of Virginia, I was commanded of the Holy spirit, and among other communications I delivered them a copy of the message which about ten years before I had delivered to President Adams, with the documents attending it, covered by a letter of seven black seals. This was not acted upon by them, and although the contents of this letter was of the highest consequence to the world, and especially to these United States, and to myself, yet some time after the rising of the assembly, none of these papers could be found, except a copy of the letter of seven seals which had been separately deposited. Being engaged in a mercantile line of life, and having made shipments of tobacco, &amp;c., to Europe, I had repeatedly applied to the bank of Virginia for a loan towards the prosecution of my business, and although I offered several good endorsers, and one of them holding upwards of twenty-six shares in the bank, no discount was granted me. In the spring of 1811, I found in the city of Richmond a night school, chiefly for free male adults of colour, and obtained a competent white tutor on liberal wages to keep it, and, on the 10th of last March, recommended in the public prints, similar institutions throughout the Union. This advertisement was suppressed in the paper called the Argus, by some influential characters, and the editor on the 14th of the same month published an apology for the suppression. Two days after the tutor of the school published, in the same paper, his determination to stick by the school, unless it was put down by a verdict from a proper tribunal. A few days afterwards the sergeant of the city served me with a summons to appear before the court af hustings, to shew cause why an information should not be filed against me, on behalf of the commonwealth, for a nuisance, for publishing an encouragement for night schools for people of colour, &amp;c.; I attended the April court, and got leave to plead my own cause; the case, however, was postponed 'till the next court in May; on coming out of court in April, I immediately advertised in the papers, that I intended to establish in the city of Richmond, a seminary of learning of the arts and sciences, and of the living languages, as soon as I could get proper tutors, for the benefit, chiefly, of free people of colour. About this time, there happened a small difference betwixt myself and wife, about my horses and driver of my hack; this however, was soon made up and when quiet in our own house, a neighbor opened the gate, came into our house with another person, and disturbed our quiet—he was requested to retire, and of course went off, but immediately brought the master of police with a constable, and without more ado, both myself and wife were sent to jail, where we remained the night, and could not get out 'till bail bonds were given for our appearance at next court. The court on trial cleared us immediately with eclat. But no satisfaction was offered for the insult and injury of imprisonment, &amp;c. This transaction brought fresh to mind, the many foils experienced since the year 1800, in the repeated attempts I had made to obtain justice; and although “man is man, and all the sex are one;” yet I considered that under existing circumstances, in the State of Virginia, a man of colour at present, had but a slender chance of success, in going to law with weighty officers of the land. I therefore concluded to make an innocent noise in my own house, by singing, dancing, &amp;c. and walking the streets harmlessly with my cane in hand, bareheaded, &amp;c., in so conspicuous a manner, as to draw the attention of influential characters, who being induced to ask me the cause, might on hearing my complaint, have formed some plan towards palliating my grievances. In this manner, on the 23d of May, 1811, I was going through Richmond trying to raise money to pay into the bank, and refund some I had borrowed, to which end I offered double the amount wanted, of personal property in hand, to the money holders, and to the president and cashier, of the bank, as noted, all without effect; in the midst of my career, I was taken up by the mandate of the master of police, and carried before a called court. I told them I was extremely ill treated, and explained in what manner, and assured them on the word of a man of strict honor, that I had a new name, Pherson, son of Christ, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and prevailed on them to read the 19th chapter of the Revalations , which contains my appointment. They, however, listened not to my argument, and doomed me a lunatic, and sent me forthwith to jail, where I remained three weeks, and then was sent to the hospital in Williamsburg, which by-the-bye, was a fortunate move for me, in many respects. </p> <p> I was very sick in jail, the tone of my stomach was so changed, that it would retain scarcely any thing. My estate was put into the hands of others—my notes were protested at bank—my other debts remained unpaid—my property seized by the sheriffs for pretended claims, and sold for less than half cost—my workmen in the country left their work—my family thrown into confusion, poverty and distress—myself buried alive, as it were, whilst I might have been earning by my labor, half a dollar or a dollar per hour—loss of bargains—my credit gone, and in fact, the whole of my affairs were in the high road, going fast to ruin. And this was the humane treatment which the magistrates of the city of Richmond shewed to a man who had faithfully served his country in every direction all his life, whilst as a messenger of the Great God, they should have fostered him, and cried out aloud, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest”—for behold! I most positively declare, “I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people,” and more especially to these United States of Columbia. During my stay in jail, I appealed by letter to most of the respectable citizens of the city, and to the Chancellor of the State, as noted, without redress, and in the meanwhile I advertised that I intended to petition Congress for them to take my letter of seven black seals and its contents into their serious consideration. I also wrote messages from Omnipotence to the King of Great Britain, Napoleon Bonaparte, the Pope of Rome, and to other potentates, &amp;c. </p> <p> After being confined a while in the hospital at Williamsburg, I was introduced to the court of directors. They very politely asked me to seat myself, and spoke in such terms of tenderness, and with such a fellow feeling, as would have done high honor to the several Judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. They questioned me upon many points, and patiently heard my answers and arguments, and at length discharged me with eclat, as noted, “an honest man is the noblest work of God.” Let them be asked what construction they placed on the decision of the court at Richmond, Then, thought I, as justice in all its dignity hath appeared at the old capitol of the Old Dominion, it will surely soon find its way to the new capitol of the Old Dominion, and from thence spread itself, in all directions, all over the world, coincident with ancient holy writ, which expressly says, that the law of the world was to go from the Old Dominion. Search the Scriptures and see this land, and the present time emphatically pointed out by Isaiah and others. Therefore, like a large stone dropped from an eminence into the middle of a spacious round pond of still water, it will make a frill from the centre, which will reach each bank all round, at one and the same time; or in other words, it may appear similar to the origin, growth and fullness of the Christian religion. </p> <p> Happy, happy, thrice happy land! thought I, now I begin to see the dawn of New Zion. New Jerusalem begins to rise to my view; and the sincere prayer of my heart is, that it may speedily mount to its zenith of glory, and spread its divine rays all over the terraqueous globe! </p> <p> From Williamsburg I went to Norfolk, and had printed many copies of the note of my conversion and commission, and pasted them up in Norfolk and Portsmouth. Whilst in Norfolk, I was singing one evening in my lodgings, and two watchmen of the borough pulled me out of bed, and threw me into the cage, and caused loss of the silver seals of my appointment. I mean to try at their next district court if I cannot obtain some degree of justice from the borough for this inhospitable outrage. As I passed through Hampton, where I again stuck up my notes, a certain pilot by the name of William Parish, whom I did not know, came on board of Robert Thomas' packet boat, where I had taken lodgings, because I could not get any in the town, on Sunday night, the 23d of June, 1811, and without any provocation whatever on my part, gave me a most unmerciful drubbing, and bruised me in such a manner, that next morning it was judged proper, and there was let from me a quart of blood. A companion of his, is witness to this affair—another pilot named James Hicks; there were also present two black men on board. Next morning I indicted Parish, and sued him in $1,000 damages, to be tried in Hampton, at September term. I left my printed notes in every public place, 'till I reached the city of Richmond, where, on my arrival, I pasted them through the city, and at the same time made a great outcry of the commission I bore. Next day I fixed them up in the most public places in Manchester, and the day following, I went to Petersburg, and there pasted them up at the most public places, and whilst I was detained there by sickness, a few days, I wrote several letters, which are noted. On my return, I commenced suits in the District Court of Richmond, for September term next, viz: against the Commonwealth of Virginia, levied on the Attorney General for the State, for the recovery of my letter of seven black seals, with all its contents, damages 10,000 times 10,000 millions of dollars; against a certain doctor, by the name of James Drew McCaw, for entering my gate and house without being called for, and disturbing the peace of my family, and afterwards causing the master of police for the city of Richmond to come to my house without a just cause, damages $20,000; against the master of police for entering my gate and door, and imprisoning myself and wife without a just cause, damages $50,000; against Dr. John Adams, one of the called court, who, after he had heard my protestations, and read at my request, the 19th chapter of Revelations, where I showed him I was King of Kings and Lord of Lords; he first gave it as his opinion, that I was a lunatic, and was at the instance of my imprisonment, &amp;c., damages $100,000; and against every magistrate of the city of Richmond, who sat on the bench on my trial, as to the charge of lunacy, and acquiesced in my imprisonment, &amp;c., &amp;c., damages $100,000 each. </p> <p> I now most particularly call the attention of the public to this grand point: that I sue not for the justice that is due me in my private and individual character, as a citizen of these United States, under certain restrictions, as in that case I should scarcely have made any stir in the affair at all; but I sue for justice to be established, and to be rendered to the Great Creator Almighty God, thro' his embassador Pherson, son of Christ, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and the amount of damage is fixed to satisfy the insult and injury offered the dignified personage represented, on a ratio similar to an indignity offered through an embassador, by one potentate of the earth to another. </p> <p> When the honorable courts, and the gentlemen of the jury see the humble Christopher McPherson standing before them, they positively and most unequivocally see the true, real-established, and declared representative of Christ Jesus the Lord of Glory, in the actual stead of himself, petitioning them for justice—who wants nothing more from them than pure and impartial justice, and justice only. God the Son and God the Holy Ghost, have complied with their part of the contract, and as this is the time, they have desired me to demand publicly of God the Father, to yield them the kingdom of this world, in peace, love and justice. The seat of government is New Zion, New Jerusalem, the United States of Columbia, where the Jews are restored, as was promised, and by a copious view it will be found that the wife hath made herself ready, for the true Jew is the one who is made so by the Holy Spirit of Christ Jesus our Lord; and thank God, that spirit in the heart of man, is at present, more prevalent in this land than elsewhere, as is fully evinced by the flourishing state of Christ's Church, throughout the Union. </p> <p> Given under my hand, and the seals of my appointment, in the city of Richmond, Virginia, on the 4th day of August, and 35th year of Columbian Independence, and the 13th year after planting in Columbia the seed of the Millennium. </p> CHRIST. McPHERSON, ALIAS PHERSON, SON OF CHRIST, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Certificates, &amp;c. <p> The bearer hereof, Christopher McPherson, a free man of color, having applied to me to say what I know respecting him, this may certify that I remember the said Christopher McPherson since he was a child, and have understood that he was the son of Mr. Charles McPherson, a Scotish gentleman, formerly in the business of Alexander Baine, esq.; his mother a black woman, named Clarinda, and at the time of his birth, I've understood, she belonged to Judethan Harper, then a resident in Louisa county. </p> ELIZABETH PRICE. 8 th May , 1799. <p> I, Francis Clarke, of Fluvanna county, do hereby certify, that between the years 1760 and 1764, I was well acquainted with a very shining black woman, by the name of Clarinda, said to be the mother of a man of color who is well known in Virginia, by the name of Christopher McPherson, clerk to David Ross, esq. The said woman was slave to the widow Winston, who, at that time, lived in Louisa; and a certain Judethan Harper, shop-joiner, married the said widow. Mr. Alexander Baine had a store at the residence of the said widow Winston's, and a certain Charles McPherson, a Scotchman, was the manager of it, and it was currently reported, and generally believed, that the said Charles McPherson was the father of the before named Christopher McPherson, son to the afore-mentioned Clarinda, who afterwards became the property of the aforesaid David Ross, esq. </p> Given under my hand, in Fluvanna county, the 12th of May, 1799.

Your petitioner further sheweth, that he is a free person, and a native of Virginia, and has a family; that being a mulatto, he and his family come within the provision of the said ordinance, and a house-keeper and owner of real property of considerable value in the said city, acquired by a life of long and laborious industry. He further begs leave, humbly to represent, that during the revolutionary war, he was employed as clerk for the commercial agent for the State of Virginia, and clerk of one of the Commissary Generals at the siege of Yorktown—that he afterwards was employed by the clerk of Congress as an enrolling clerk, and has since been employed as a clerk in different public offices, both under the general and State governments—and by merchants and others, in examining and settling accounts, and other business of that nature which requires fidelity, industry and a knowledge of accounts. Your petitioner trusts he may say, without fear of contradiction, that he has given general satisfaction to his employers, and that he has uniformly sustained and deserved the character of an honest, industrious man; that your petitioner and his wife, being both advanced in life, and occasionally subject to disease; it has happened, and may again happen, that the occasional use of a carriage, when they are unable to walk, may be necessary not only for their comfort but their health; and for the carrying on the business of your petitioner, which lays in various parts of the said city. Your petitioner submits without a murmur to those laws of the commonwealth which impose disabilities on that class of people to which he belongs, and as he is not disposed to deny that there may be persons with respect to whom the ordinance aforesaid might properly apply, but he humbly conceives that the said ordinance is unjust as it respects himself and family, and that it deprives him of rights to which he is entitled under the laws and constitution of this commonwealth. Your petioner humbly begs leave to state, that he has represented his case to a number of the members of the corporation of the city of Richmond, by letter, requesting that his case might be laid before the Common Hall, and that he might be exempted from the provisions of the said ordiance ; but hath not been able to obtain a decision thereon. Your petitioner is and always has been disposed to conform to all such laws and rules as the public good might be thought to require by those placed in authority; nor would he now complain, did he not sustain real inconvenience from the said ordinance, and were he not apprehensive, that as he and his wife grow older and more infirm, this inconvenience will be greatly heightened. Wherefore your petitioner humbly prays that your honorable body will be pleased to take his case into consideration, and that he may be protected in the enjoyment of such rights, as are given him by the general laws of this commonwealth; and that your honorable body will be pleased to enact such regulations as will prevent those rights from being infringed. And your petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c. </p> <p> With the above petition, was presented a vast number of certificates and letters, relative to the character, usefulness and talents of the petitioner, a very few of which are here extracted. </p> A certificate obtained in the county of Fluvanna, dated 6th May, 1799, signed by the principal citizens of the county. <p> Certificate of the Chancellor of State. —Of Christopher McPherson I have heard said many good words, and never an ill word; from my own observation I believe him to have deserved well. </p> G. WYTHE. May 20 th , 1799. <p> We have been acquainted with Christopher McPherson, a free man of color for a long time past, he having resided many years in the city of Richmond, of which we are inhabitants, and having been generally employed during that time as clerk in different public and private offices, and counting-houses in said city, and have ever considered him as a person of integrity, industry, and general good conduct. His skill in accounts, and general knowledge of business, in addition to his other qualifications, have occasioned his being much employed in the line of his business, in matters of difficulty, that required skill, care and attention. And we have every reason to believe that he has given great satisfaction to his employers. </p> RICHMOND, 11 th Nov., 1810. <p> William W. Hening, Payton Drew, Charles Blagrove, has not had occasion to employ in his service the above named Christopher McPherson, but has known him for several years, and believes him to deserve the reputation and character herein stated. </p> <p> William Dabney, Samuel Greenhow, James D. McCaw, Robert Pollard, George Pickett, sr., Edmund Randolph, George Fisher, H. Dance, John D. Blair, as to his good behavior, the rest he believes from report. </p> <p> John Wickham, Thomas Marshall, Benjamin Botts, William Wirt, John Warden, William Forester, J. B. Dandridge can confidently testify as to the extraordinary industry and fidelity of Christopher McPherson, having known him first in the employment of the late most worthy clerk of the Chancery Court, and there been an eye witness of his labors, day and night, and last in the late office of the Supervisor for Virginia, where he received the enormous wages, of from 23 shillings to four dollars per diem, which was thought to be judiciously paid by the best officers. C. McP. at one time, accomplished in about three days, a piece of work assigned by the clerk of the C. C. for two weeks' labor; this that officer often told with astonishment. J. B.

Bently Anderson was an assistant clerk for Mr. Tinsley, in the Chancery office, when Christopher McPherson did a great deal of writing in said office, and believes he was the first who suggested the convenience of an alphabet to the court docket, which is made out in his own hand-writing. </p> <p> I do hereby certify, that some time about the year 1798, while Christopher McPherson resided near to the town of Columbia, in Fluvanna county, and acted as chief clerk in the office of David Ross, esq., I resided in the said town, and then commanded a battalion of the militia; that some time on a Sunday's evening, notice was given to me that a large number of negroes had collected near to Mr. Ross's office, in a most riotous manner, and that it was apprehended some of them would be murdered, as they had taken sides, and were on the point of engaging in battle, with sticks, clubs, &amp;c. I instantly mounted my horse and rode in haste, with my sword and pistols to the place; when I came near the spot, I found that the information I had received was correct; and seeing about 30 or 40 negroes collected, and having only one or two white men with me, I was apprehensive it would be difficult to reduce them to order, as most of them appeared to be drunk and violently enraged. I, however, rushed in among them, and having ordered the first I came up with to be silent, and not move a step from the spot until I could have the whole collected and brought into town for trial before a magistrate, and not being obeyed, proceeded to strike two or three of them; just at this moment I perceived Christopher McPherson at some small distance from me in the edge of ths woods, with a sword drawn, (and he being a mulatto,) I did not know, (notwithstanding his general good and peaceable behavior,) but he might be concerned in the riot. I rode instantly towards him, and as soon as I could hear distinctly what he said, I heard him declare that he would cut off the arm of the first negro who should strike a blow; and endeavoring by every means in his power to suppress the riot, which, with his assistance, was shortly done, and the principals punished. </p> <p> I have been acquainted with Christopher McPherson, about 15 or 16 years, and always found him a well-behaved, orderly and peaceable man. And in the instance above mentioned he acted in a most exemplary and courageous manner, exposing his own person to imminent danger to preserve peace and order. </p> Given under my hand, this 25th day of November, 1810.
